If you need someone who can deliver, we are born with that character.\n\n(2) I love working with companies that are pioneers in their industry. Normally they have complex problems for us to solve. We learn every step of the way working with them. If you have a complex project, I would love to speak with you. If you are hungry for challenges and looking for a tech company in Vietnam you also should join us.\n\n(3) We focus on emerging technology as I believe that blockchain will foster trust and consortium, AI will free us from labor works, VR/AR will change the ways we collaborate and interact. If you share the same vision, I would love to connect and have a chat.\n\n(4) I am very keen to help people in the ways possible. If you read my profile and think that I can help you in some ways, feel free to drop me a line. I am also trying to scale our agency to 10M ARR, if you can help in some ways, please let me know.\n\n(5) I practice meditation at the very beginning level :)\n\nIf you make this far, we should connect!",

MY WRITING IS ORGANIC USING REAL INTELLIGENCE (AI wishes it could write like me)\n\nI'm not bossy. I'm BOSS. A UN Women VP, provocatrice, attorney/law professor turned world class author and negotiation GOAT . . .\n\n(Buckle up. This is ...\"a lot\")\n\n🦸🏻‍♀️ I help women harness the power of everyday negotiation—from conning a toddler into eating peas to running the boardroom. I authored the Little Black Dress of negotiation books. Why?\n\nBecause negotiation isn’t just for business. It’s everybody’s business 🧐\n\n(But you don’t need me to “empower” you. Nor do I sell a “masterclass” or certification from my own “institute”)\n\n🌍 World Mediation Peace Activist. Benevolent & incurable explorer (dubbed “creative savant”—you know who you are). A bit wild at ❤️‍🔥, I struggle with purpose and disrupt with goodwill—through advocacy, teaching, writing, broadcasting, philanthropy, art & sports.\n\n🗣️ Polyglot. Passionate about people & social progress. JEDI agent (not a Star Wars ref). I’ve practiced law in private, public & non-profit sectors; have taught internationally, including over two decades as faculty at two University of California law schools.\n\nI get that people are messy multitudes—and how they actually behave in conflict & decision-making.\nWhat makes me next-level? Decades of deep experience in negotiation, behavioral economics, game theory, plus dope training in:\n\n✔️ Emotional micro-expressions\n✔️ Lie detection\n✔️ Neuroscience & decision analysis\n\nOh, and I know the #1 most stealth negotiation skill. 😎\n\n(Kinda like x-ray vision. Hint: it’s NOT “speaking your truth.”)\n\nWHAT I’M NOT:\n\n❌ A sales/marketing bro who built my expertise off a “masterclass”\n❌ A brand\n❌ Your income stream\n❌ After your 💰 or approval\n❌ One to trademark words. Ahem™ 🙄 (you know the type)\n\nSpecial needs parent & dog whisperer—chaos doesn’t faze me, and persistence is my default setting. CEO of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit providing dogs & sibling support for families with special needs kids.\n\n🫶 Turn-ons: Cake, shoes, pour-over coffee, decent literature\n🤢 Turn-offs: NIMBYism, vapid buzzwords, elitism, posers\n\n💡 Meyers-Briggs type? ENFJ-A (same 2% club as Obama & Oprah).\n\n🕸️See more on pactumfactum.com, but TLDR: \nI’m 95% human Labrador (begs the question: what’s the other 5%?). Find it endearing or annoying. That's on you. Either way, I’ll be me because, as Oscar Wilde said, “Everyone else is taken.”\n\nP.S.\n❌ I don’t do casual Zoom coffee chats\n✅ I’ve already overpaid it forward",

This hands-on business building experience sharpened my instinct for scaling growth, building high-performing teams, and creating value from scratch.\n\nAs a serial entrepreneur turned corporate leader, I’ve since led transformative initiatives at startups, media agencies, and Fortune 500s. My ability to align GTM strategies with business outcomes has consistently driven revenue growth, market expansion, and brand equity.\n\nAcross roles, I’ve blended strategic vision with creative execution. As Director of a leading media agency, I led 100+ ad films and 1,000+ omnichannel campaigns, shaping brand narratives for marquee clients. At a successful smart city mobility startup, I expanded operations across four countries, and helped drive a $6M GMV with a successful fund raising & merger.\n\nNotable achievements include:\n•\tDigitalizing a fintech business, growing GMV by 300% to ₹6000 Cr within 9 months.\n•\tLaunching a quick commerce vertical for an FMCG company—partnering with 112 brands, onboarding 650+ delivery personnel, and increasing order volumes from zero to 300/day.\n•\tScaling a smart mobility solution that generated 1.6 million parking transactions/month across four countries.\n\nWhat I bring is more than just experience—it's forward-thinking marketing leadership rooted in future-ready capabilities. I integrate AI-driven strategies, Web 3.0, XR, blockchain, and emerging digital innovations into my approach, delivering campaigns and customer experiences that don’t just perform today, but are built for tomorrow.\n\nAs a thought leader & startup mentor, I’m deeply engaged with CXOs, investors, and startup ecosystems. My insights have shaped investor relations, keynote addresses, GTM advisory, and strategic partnerships across global markets.\n\nWhether it’s leading cross-functional teams, optimizing performance, launching new ventures, or navigating complex markets—my focus remains the same: to build brands that resonate, strategies that scale, and systems that deliver.",

These experiences have allowed me to grow as a professional in my field.\n\nDuring my time as the former COO/Vice President of APJ Sales at Nutanix, I had the opportunity to lead a team through a significant overhaul of our approach in the region.

Additionally, I'm proud of the work I did at NetApp, where we were able to elevate the business to a remarkable $1B while fostering a positive workplace culture.\n\nPresently, I am engaged in a focused learning sabbatical, dedicating time to delve into advanced domains such as AI/ML/DL and Data Analytics. My enthusiasm lies in furthering my knowledge and skillset, aiming to contribute meaningfully to evolving business paradigms leveraging the expertise accumulated throughout my career.\n\nSome highlights from my career include:: \n\n2019 to 2023\nNutanix Asia Pacific/Japan\nVice President /COO Asia Pacific Japan Sales: Lead the transformation of Nutanix APJ - from 1.0 to Nutanix 2.0 - including redesigning the Strategy, Market Segments, GTM, Leadership, Resourcing\n\n2018 to 2019\nAspect Software Asia Pacific/Japan/Middle East\nSVP/GM - APJ/Middle East: #1 priority was to ‘ready’ the org for impending sale to PE by streamlining the business.

Nous l'outillons là où il a des lacunes et l'incitons à bâtir une organisation dans laquelle son rôle est de moins en moins opérationnel et de plus en plus stratégique.\n\nNous sommes très engagés dans la réussite des objectifs du dirigeant. On permet au dirigeant de se poser les bonnes questions sans hésiter à lui donner nos points de vue issus de notre expérience transverse acquise avec les autres dirigeants qu'on accompagne. Être stratège c'est savoir regarder le plateau de jeu tel qu'il est et pas tel qu'on aimerait qu'il soit. On les aide à se regarder sans complaisance avec leurs qualités et leurs défauts.\n\nPour être efficaces, on fixe des objectifs à atteindre pendant l'accompagnement avec le dirigeant. On les pilote via nos conversations bimensuelles et par une disponibilité quotidienne.\n \nQuelques briefs récurrents :\n- J'ai du mal à être moi-même, je joue le rôle du dirigeant parce que j'ai peur de ne pas être assez. \n- J'ai besoin d'avoir une relation plus authentique avec mes associés\n- Maintenant que ma boîte grandit, j'ai besoin de faire évoluer ma façon de prendre la parole \n- Maintenant que ma boîte grandit, la culture évolue et je ne sais pas comment la piloter. \n- J'ai du mal à sortir les mains de l'opérationnel \n- Jusque là je fonctionne au talent mais je sens qu'il faut que j'organise ma performance. \n- Quand je délègue, j'ai plus tendance à abandonner le sujet à quelqu'un qu'à manager.\n- J'ai l'impression que mes employés ne travaillent pas ou travaillent mal.\n- Je ne sais pas définir le cadre de mon rôle. \n- J'ai du mal à définir les critères culturels et l'onboarding d'un bon recrutement.\n\nVoici le lien pour s'inscrire à notre newsletter Punchline : punchline.kessel.media\n\nPour en savoir plus sur nos accompagnements, contactez-moi directement à jean@punchie.fr ou au 0618534783.",
